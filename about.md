title: About me
---
I've been developing applications since 2009. I started my career building ASP.NET WebForms apps in C#, but since then, I've gone through a great deal of the .NET stack and more recently had the opportunity to develop apps in Ruby on Rails. I love reading and and exploring other tech stacks, but most of my working experience has centered in the .NET world. I'm a big advocate of automated testing (Notice I didn't say TDD), and I particularly enjoy discovering and working on tools that make day to day development go faster and smoother.

Below are some of the technologies I've worked in.

### Web
* ASP.NET WebForms
* ASP.NET Dynamic Data
* ASP.NET MVC
* ASP.NET Web API
* NodeJS
* Ruby on Rails

### JavaScript

* Vue.js
* Angular


### Client
* Windows Forms
* WPF

## Scripting
* Powershell

### Database

  * SQL Server Integration Services
  * SQL Server Reporting Services
* Postgre SQL
