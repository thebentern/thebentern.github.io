Hello, internet.

So this is my first entry... I've thought a great deal about creating a blog at times in the past, but the pace of my life made it difficult for me to do so. I've come to realize however, that life probably isn't going to slow down. So I'm going to take this opportunity to start sharing some of the things I deal with on a daily basis and things that help me be a more efficient developer, both software and hardware. I hope that they are helpful to you, and if you have suggestions or alternatives to anything relevant to my entries, please comment and share them. I love hearing about different techniques, tools and technologies.

If you would like to read a little bit about my background, visit the [About me](/about) section.
